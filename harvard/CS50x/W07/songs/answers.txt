If `songs.db` contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, we can characterize their audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of these songs. Running the following queries on the database would give us these averages:

```sql
SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs;
SELECT AVG(valence) FROM songs;
SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
